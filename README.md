👋 Hi, I’m @devajpk, a passionate Flutter Developer focused on building cross-platform mobile applications with Flutter and Dart.
👀 I’m interested in creating intuitive user experiences, optimizing mobile app performance, and exploring cutting-edge technologies like Firebase and GraphQL.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Flutter techniques, state management solutions like Riverpod, and diving deeper into CI/CD pipelines and app deployment.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, Flutter apps, and mobile-first applications that can help solve real-world problems.
